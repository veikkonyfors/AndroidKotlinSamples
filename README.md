# Android Samples in Kotlin

This repository holds sample apps for Android in Kotlin.
Maintained by Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1

## Introduction

Each sample app is located in its own subdirectory at subdirectory named app.
Havent't figured out how to get those subdirs on this level with Android Studio integration.
If someone could give ,me a hint on that, I would most appreciate it.

Even like this, one should be able to get hold on individually samples.
